## Overview

Let $f$ be a function with [[derivatives]] of order $n$ at the point $x = a$. Then there exists one and only one polynomial $P$ of degree $\leq n$ which satisfies the $n + 1$ conditions $$P(a) = f(a), \quad P'(a) = f'(a), \quad\ldots, \quad P^{(n)}(a) = f^{(n)}(a).$$

This polynomial, the **Taylor polynomial of degree $n$ generated by $f$ at $a$**, is given by formula $$P(x) = \sum_{k=0}^n \frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x - a)^k.$$

This is often written instead using [[algebra/functions#Operations|operator]] $T_n$ on $f$. That is, $P = T_nf$ or $P = T_n(f)$. To indicate the dependence on $a$, we can instead write $P = T_n(f; a)$.
