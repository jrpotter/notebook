## Overview

**Connection** refers to the linking and degree of safety between a player's stones. Two stones do not have to be adjacent for them to be considered connected.

Generally speaking, connections are classified in one of three ways:

1. Stones form a **solid connection** if they belong to the same chain, i.e. they can only be removed from the board together.
2. Stones in different chains form a **tactical connection** if there is no viable way for an opponent to separate them.
3. Stones in the same group form a **strategic connection** if they function as a single unit for strategic purposes like attack, defence, and living.
