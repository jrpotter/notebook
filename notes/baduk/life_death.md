## Overview

There are two types of status that a group may have: **settled** and **unsettled**. A settled group is one that is dead or alive as it stands. An unsettled group is one that lives or dies depending on who makes the next move.

A group is said to be **alive in ko** if it can live by winning a [[ko]].
