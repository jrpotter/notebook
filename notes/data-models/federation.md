## Overview

Generally speaking, a federation refers to some collection within which each member has some degree of internal autonomy. In computing, it often refers to some aggregated view over individual resources. Some examples include:

* **Data**. Federated data typically refers to grouping of data from different sources into a single view.
* **Databases**. A federated database is one that maps multiple autonomous databases into a single view.
* **Networking**. A federation in this context might mean the inter-operation of distinct networks.
