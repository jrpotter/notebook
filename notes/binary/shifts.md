## Overview

Left shift operations (`<<`) drop the `k` most significant bits and fills the right end of the result with `k` zeros. Right shift operations (`>>`) are classified in two ways:

* **Logical**
	* Drops the `k` least significant bits and fills the left end of the result with `k` zeros.
	* This mode is always used when calling `>>` on unsigned data.
	* Sometimes denoted as `>>>` to disambiguate from arithmetic right shifts.
* **Arithmetic**
	* Drops the `k` least significant bits and fills the left end of the result with `k` copies of the most significant bit.
	* This mode is usually used when calling `>>` on signed data.

In C, it is undefined behavior to shift by more than the width $w$ of an integral type. Typically though, only the last $w$ bits are considered in the computation. For example, given `int32_t x`, `(x << 32) = (x << 0)`.

## Arithmetic

Shifting left by a single bit is equivalent to multiplication by $2$. Likewise, logically shifting right is equivalent to floor division by $2$. This is most clearly seen by examining the decimal expansion of a binary value. For example, consider $$001101_2 = 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^0$$

Multiplying by $2$ yields $$2 \cdot (2^3 + 2^2 + 2^0) = 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^1 = 011010_2$$ 

Dividing by $2$ yields $$(2^3 + 2^2 + 2^0) / 2 = 2^2 + 2^1 = 000110_2$$
