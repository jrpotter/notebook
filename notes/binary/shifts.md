## Overview

Left shift operations (`<<`) drop the `k` most significant bits and fills the right end of the result with `k` zeros. Right shift operations (`>>`) are classified in two ways:

* **Logical**
	* Drops the `k` least significant bits and fills the left end of the result with `k` zeros.
	* This mode is always used when calling `>>` on unsigned data.
	* Sometimes denoted as `>>>` to disambiguate from arithmetic right shifts.
* **Arithmetic**
	* Drops the `k` least significant bits and fills the left end of the result with `k` copies of the most significant bit.
	* This mode is usually used when calling `>>` on signed data.

In C, it is undefined behavior to shift by more than the width $w$ of an integral type. Typically though, only the last $w$ bits are considered in the computation. For example, given `int32_t x`, `(x << 32) = (x << 0)`.

%%ANKI
Basic
Ignoring UB, what *typically* happens when shifting an `int32_t` by `k â‰¥ 32` bits?
Back: The shift value is interpreted as `k mod 32`.
