## Overview

The **additive principle** states that two finite and disjoint sets $A$ and $B$ satisfy $$|A \cup B| = |A| + |B|$$

This can be generalized to any number of finite and disjoint sets in the obvious way.

What does the additive principle state?
Back: Given finite and disjoint sets $A$ and $B$, $|A \cup B| = |A| + |B|$.

The additive property applies to sets exhibiting what two properties?
Back: Finiteness and disjointedness.

%%ANKI
Basic
Why does $|A \cup B| \neq |A| + |B|$ in the general sense?
Back: Members of $A \cap B$ are counted twice erroneously.

How do we denote $A$ and $B$ are disjoint using standard set notation?
Back: $A \cap B = \varnothing$
