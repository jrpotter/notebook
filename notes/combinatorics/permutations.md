## Overview

A **permutation** of some $n$ objects is a (possible) rearrangement of those $n$ objects. The number of permutations is $n!$ since there are $n$ possible ways to pick the first object, $(n - 1)$ possible ways to pick the second, and so on.

```c
void permutations_aux(
  const size_t n,
  int A[static n],
  int res[static n],
  uint64_t choices
) {
  if (!choices) {
    for (size_t i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      printf("%d ", A[res[i]]);
    }
    printf("\n");
    return;
  }

  unsigned int weight = n - bit_weight(choices);
  for (unsigned int i = 0; i < 64; ++i) {
    uint64_t next = 1L << i;
    if (choices & next) {
      res[weight] = i;
      permutations_aux(n, A, res, choices & ~next);
    }
  }
}

void permutations(const size_t n, int A[static n]) {
  int *res = malloc(sizeof(int) * n);
  permutations_aux(n, A, res, (1L << n) - 1);
  free(res);
}
```

The above approach prints out all permutations of a given array, provided the array contains at most `64` digits. It relies on `bit_weight` as defined in [[binary/index|binary]].

## Falling Factorials

If we generalize to choosing $k \leq n$ elements of $k$ objects, we can calculate the $k$-permutation of $n$. This is denoted as $(n)_k$, sometimes called the **falling factorial**. $$(n)_k = \frac{n!}{(n - k)!}$$

The derivation works by noting that we have $n - 0$ possible ways to pick the first object, $n - 1$ ways to pick the second, up until $n - (k - 1)$ ways to pick the last object.
