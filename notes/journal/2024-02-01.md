* Today was the first day using the FSRS algorithm with Anki. Continuing to use Just "Again" and "Good" on my original deck and using all options when using the Obsidian-generated deck. Goal is to eventually migrate back to using all the options.
* Spent some time migrating the Quartz setup to use Nix instead. I lose the ability to run Quartz locally (at least without more work), but upgrades are significantly easier. Theoretically the only thing I should care about is that my notes look good in Markdown/Obsidian anyways so fine with this trade-off.
* Read 해님 달님 (The Sun and the Moon) from Korean stories.
* Read sections 11.2 and 13.6 of "Database System Concepts".
* Practiced [reverse keyboard identification](https://www.musictheory.net/exercises/keyboard-reverse).
* Spent time learning how Nix's `callpackage` function works.
