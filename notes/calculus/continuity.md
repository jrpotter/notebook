## Overview

A function $f$ is said to be **continuous at a point $p$** if $f$ is defined at $p$ and $$\lim_{x \rightarrow p} f(x) = f(p).$$

A **jump discontinuity** is a discontinuity formed when the left- and right-hand limits both exist at a point but are not equal.  An **infinite discontinuity** is a discontinuity in which the function takes arbitrarily large values at a point. A **removable discontinuity** is a discontinuity that could be removed by redefining the function at the given point.

### Uniform Continuity

Let $f$ be continuous on $[a, b]$. The **span** of $f$ in interval $[a, b]$ is the difference $\mathop{\text{sup}} f - \mathop{\text{inf}} f$. Then for all $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a finite [[intervals#Partitions|partition]] of $f$ such that the span of $f$ in every subinterval is less than $\epsilon$.
