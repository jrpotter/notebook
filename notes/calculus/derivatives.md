## Overview

Let $f$ be a function defined on some open interval $(a, b)$. The **derivative** of $f$, denoted $f'(x)$, is given by $$f'(x) = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h},$$

provided this limit exists.

Back: Provided the limit exists, as $$\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}.$$
