* Purged some Anki flashcards with tags: `lua`, `cncf`. In general, want to avoid on this next pass including any sort of flashcards around languages outside of C and:
	* Lean
	* Nix
	* Assembly
* Made distinctions in flashcards between POSIX `awk` features and GNU `awk` features. Only a few exceptions that may have been misleading so far (GNU's implementation allowing `FS` to be null and `RS` to be a regexp).
	* Actually, going further, just removing this altogether. I'll continue reading about `awk` but I'm not interested in translating into flashcards unless it turns out I really start using it heavily.
* Read Chapter 5 "Printing" in "GAWK: Effective AWK Programming".
* Notes on [[x86]] history.
