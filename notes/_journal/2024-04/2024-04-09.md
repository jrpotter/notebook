* Continued working on hide-and-seek application.
	* Decided at this point we should switch off of live views. Considering we want to eventually add mobile support, live views aren't compatible. We might as well have the web application work similarly. It will be a fairly large refactor, but I'd like to get it done before this weekend's playtest.
