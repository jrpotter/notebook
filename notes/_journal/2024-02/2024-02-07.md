* Read section 4.1 of "GAWK: Effective AWK Programming".
* Began translating more of "The Science of Programming" into flashcards.
* Begin re-reading order of growth concepts.
* Solved [Palindrome Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/) and [Regular Expression Matching](https://leetcode.com/problems/regular-expression-matching/description/) (though my solution in the latter is subpar, using recursion instead of dynamic programming).
