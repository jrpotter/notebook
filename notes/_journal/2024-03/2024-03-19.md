* Read sections 3.1 through 3.3 of "Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective". Skimmed the rest of the chapter.
	* Piggybacking off of this, read some historical context on different processor developers. Though I'd like to learn a bit more about the different processors and architectures, I'll limit my focus to the x86 processor line for the time-being.
