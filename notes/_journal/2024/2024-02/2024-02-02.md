* Read 효자 호랑이 (The Filial Tiger).
* Read through [Project #1 - Buffer Pool](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2022/project1/) in anticipation of my call with Kevin later.
	* Call was pushed back to next week.
* Upgraded to Zotero 7. It's a beta version but already has some nice quality of life improvements I want to take advantage of.
	* Dark mode.
	* Ability to comment on snapshots.
* Answered [String to Integer (atoi)](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-to-integer-atoi/description/). Admittedly though I floundered around. I should try and think more critically at each step instead of getting impatient like I did.
* More reading on `awk`. This time around variables.
* Begin deep dive into insertion sort. Starting off with the basics, but want to think much more broadly on the role of insertion sort throughout computing.
