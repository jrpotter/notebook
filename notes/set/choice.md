## Overview

This axiom assumes the existence of some choice function capable of selecting some element from a nonempty set. Note this axiom is controversial because it is non-constructive: there is no procedure we can follow to decide which element was chosen.

%%ANKI
Basic
In Russell's analogy, why is AoC unnecessary to pick left shoes from an infinite set of shoe pairs?
Back: The choice function can be defined directly, i.e. as "pick left shoe".

In Russell's analogy, why is AoC necessary to pick socks from an infinite set of sock pairs?
Back: There is no choice function to choose/prefer one sock from/over the other.

### Relation Form

For any relation $R$ there exists a function $F \subseteq R$ with $\mathop{\text{dom}}F = \mathop{\text{dom}}R$.

Given relation $R$, AoC implies existence of function $F$. How does $F$ relate to $R$?

### Infinite Cartesian Product Form

For any set $I$ and function $H$ with domain $I$, if $H(i) \neq \varnothing$ for all $i \in I$, then $\bigtimes_{i \in I} H(i) \neq \varnothing$.
