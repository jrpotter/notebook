## Overview

A **non-strict well ordering on $A$** is a non-strict total order on $A$ with the additional property that every nonempty subset of $A$ has a minimum element.

A **strict well ordering on $A$** is a strict total order on $A$ with the additional property that every nonempty subset of $A$ has a minimal element.

In the context of well orderings, an **infinitely descending chain** on set $A$ is an infinitely descending [[cardinality#Sequences|sequence]] into $A$. That is, a function $f \colon \omega \rightarrow A$ such that for all $n \in \omega$, $f(n^+) < f(n)$. A [[total|strict total ordering]] is a well ordering if and only if there is no infinitely descending chain.

We say a set $A$ is **well ordered by epsilon** if and only if the following relation is a well ordering on $A$: $$\in_A = \{ \langle x, y \rangle \in A \times A \mid x \in y \}$$

*Why* does the definition of strict well orderings use minimals instead of minimums?

## Initial Segments

Let $<$ be a strict well ordering on set $A$. Then the **initial segment up to $t$**, for some $t \in A$, is $$\mathop{\text{seg}_<} t = \{ x \in A \mid x < t \}.$$

For a set $B$, define set $^{<A}B$ and [[classes|class]] $^{<A}\mathbf{V}$ respectively as $$\begin{align*}
^{<A}B & = \{ f \mid \text{for some } t \in A, f \text{ is a function from } \mathop{\text{seg}_<}{t} \text{ into } B \}, \\
^{<A} \mathbf{V} & = \{ f \mid \text{for some } t \in A, f \text{ is a function with } \mathop{\text{dom}} f = \mathop{\text{seg}_<} t \}.

## Trichotomy

For any two well-ordered structures, either they are [[structures#Isomorphisms|isomorphic]] or one is isomorphic to an initial segment of the other. More precisely, let $<_A$ and $<_B$ be well orderings on $A$ and $B$ respectively. Then exactly one of the following holds:

1. $\langle A, <_A \rangle \cong \langle B, <_B \rangle$,
2. $\langle A, <_A \rangle \cong \langle \mathop{\text{seg}}b, <_B^\circ \rangle$ for some $b \in B$,
3. $\langle \mathop{\text{seg}}a, <_A^\circ \rangle \cong \langle B, <_B \rangle$ for some $a \in A$.

Note the $\degree$ symbol is used to denote an [[set/order/index#Induced Orderings|induced ordering]].
