## Overview

The study of the operations of union ($\cup$), intersection ($\cap$), and set difference ($-$), together with the inclusion relation ($\subseteq$), goes by the **algebra of sets**.

## Laws

The algebra of sets obey laws reminiscent (but not exactly) of the algebra of real numbers.

### Commutative Laws

For any sets $A$ and $B$, $$\begin{align*} A \cup B & = B \cup A \\ A \cap B & = B \cap A \end{align*}$$

%%ANKI
Basic
The commutative laws of the algebra of sets apply to what operators?
Back: $\cup$ and $\cap$
Reference: Herbert B. Enderton, *Elements of Set Theory* (New York: Academic Press, 1977).
<!--ID: 1716396060616-->
END%%

%%ANKI
Basic
What does the union commutative law state?
Back: For any sets $A$ and $B$, $A \cup B = B \cup A$.
Reference: Herbert B. Enderton, *Elements of Set Theory* (New York: Academic Press, 1977).
<!--ID: 1716396060618-->

%%ANKI
Basic
What does the intersection commutative law state?
Back: For any sets $A$ and $B$, $A \cap B = B \cap A$.
Reference: Herbert B. Enderton, *Elements of Set Theory* (New York: Academic Press, 1977).

### Associative Laws

For any sets $A$ and $B$, $$\begin{align*} A \cup (B \cup C) & = (A \cup B) \cup C \\ A \cap (B \cap C) & = (A \cap B) \cap C \end{align*}$$

%%ANKI
Basic
The associative laws of the algebra of sets apply to what operators?
Back: $\cup$ and $\cap$

%%ANKI
Basic
What does the union associative law state?
Back: For any sets $A$, $B$, and $C$, $A \cup (B \cup C) = (A \cup B) \cup C$.

%%ANKI
Basic
What does the intersection associative law state?
Back: For any sets $A$, $B$, and $C$, $A \cap (B \cap C) = (A \cap B) \cap C$.
