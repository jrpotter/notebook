## Overview

A device with multiple network interfaces is said to be **multihomed**.

%%ANKI

## Modems

A **modem** (modulator-demodulator) is a device that converts data from a digital format into a format suitable for analog transmission.

It transmits data by modulating one or more carrier wave signals to encode digital information, while the receive demodulates the signal to recreate the original digital information.

%%ANKI
Basic
What is "modem" an abbreviation for?
Back: A **mo**ulator-**dem**odulator.

%%ANKI
Basic
What is the purpose of a modem?
Back: To convert data to and from a digital format to an analog format.

%%ANKI
Basic
In what direction is data converted when a modem modulates?
Back: From digital to analog.

## Routers

A **router** is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks, from one interface to another.

It performs the "traffic directing" functions of network protocols, e.g. reading the network address information in a packet header to determine the ultimate destination.

Back: To forward data packets between computer networks.
