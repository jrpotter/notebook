## Overview

A **proxy server** describes a server application that acts as an intermediary between a client requesting a resource and a server providing that resource.

A **forward proxy** is a server that routes traffic between clients and another system, usually external to the clients' network. A **reverse proxy** is a server that accepts requests from clients, forwarding them to one of many other servers.

The former typically protects clients whereas the latter typically protects servers.
