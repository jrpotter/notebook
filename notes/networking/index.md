## Overview

A **protocol** is a set of common behaviors communicated by using a common language. A **protocol suite** is a collection of related protocols. The **reference model** for the protocol suite is the design that specifies how various protocols of a protocol suite relate to each other and divide up tasks to be accomplished.

TCP/IP forms the basis of the **Internet**, a wide area network (WAN) spanning the globe. The Internet refers to the ability to provide basic communication of messages between computers. The **World Wide Web** (WWW) is an application that uses the Internet for communication.

A **connection-oriented** network is one in which "per-flow" **state** is established prior to the exchange of data. This is done using a signaling protocol that supports connection establishment, clearing, and status information.

In a connection-oriented packet network, each packet would contain an index into a state table held on each switch. Such a table would contain information on the next switch along the path for the packet.
