## Overview

A **firewall** is a network security system that controls incoming and outgoing traffic based on configurable security rules. These rules are collectively known as **firewall rules**.

**Network-based** firewalls are positioned between two or more networks. **Host-based** firewalls are deployed directly on a host.
