## Overview

A **diacritic** is a glyph added to a letter or to a basic glyph. Common diacritics include:

* The **acute** accent indicates a stressed syllable or raised pitch.
	* E.g. *exposé*, *adiós*.
* The **cedilla** is usually found under the letter 'c', indicating the letter should be pronounced as an 's'.
	* E.g. *façade*, *garçon*.
* The **circumflex** is used in Greek to indicate a rising/falling tone.
	* Other languages use it to mark length, contractions, or other vowel quality.
	* E.g. *château*, *crêpe*.
* The **diaeresis** indicates a vowel should be pronounced in a separate syllable.
	* E.g. *naïve*, *Zoë*.
* The **grave** accent indicates an unaccented syllable or a lower inflection.
	* E.g. *à la carte*, *crème*.
* The **umlaut** is used in German to indicate a vowel should be pronounced with more central or front articulation.
	* E.g. *doppelgänger*, *führer*.
