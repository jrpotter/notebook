## Overview

A **process** is an instance of a program in execution. Each program in the system runs in the **context** of some process. The context consists of the state that the program needs to run correctly. Every process is uniquely identified with a **process ID** (PID). Every process belongs to exactly one a **process group**, identified by a **process group ID** (PGID).

## Private Address Space

The **address space** of a machine with $n$-bit addresses is the possible addresses $0$, $1$, $\ldots$, $2^n - 1$. A process provides each program with its own **private address space**, private in the sense that a byte of memory in the space cannot (in general) be read or written by any other process.

## Context Switching

The kernel maintains a **context** for each process containing the state needed to restart a preempted process. **Context switching** refers to:

1. Saving the context of the current process,
2. restoring the saved context of a previously preempted process, and
3. passing control to the newly restored process.

![[context-switching.png]]

The decision-making process performed by the kernel to context switch is called **scheduling**. The **scheduler** is the specific kernel code responsible for scheduling.

%%ANKI
