## Overview

A deductive system found in certain formal systems. Proof systems are syntactic in nature. Proofs are sequences of WFFs, each of which are entailed from previous ones in the sequence. A theorem is then the last WFF in any valid sequence of WFFs.

*Why* do we say formal systems using proof systems are purely syntactic?
Back: No meaning is attached to the WFFs of the formal language.

How is it purely syntactic proof systems can produce theorems?
Back: Inference rules define how to produce theorems from sequences of WFFs.
