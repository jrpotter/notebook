## Overview

A **deterministic pushdown automaton** (DPDA) is a $6$-tuple $\langle Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, F \rangle$, where $Q$, $\Sigma$, $\Gamma$, and $F$ are all finite sets, and

1. $Q$ is the set of states,
2. $\Sigma$ is the input alphabet,
3. $\Gamma$ is the stack alphabet,
4. $\delta \colon Q \times \Sigma_\epsilon \times \Gamma_\epsilon \rightarrow (Q \times \Gamma_\epsilon) \cup \{ \varnothing \}$ is the transition function,
5. $q_0 \in Q$ is the start state, and
6. $F \subseteq Q$ is the set of accept states.

Additionally, for every $q \in Q$, $a \in \Sigma$, and $x \in \Gamma$, exactly one of the following values is not $\varnothing$: $$\delta(q, a, x), \delta(q, a, \epsilon), \delta(q, \epsilon, x), \text{and } \delta(q, \epsilon, \epsilon).$$

An **$\epsilon$-input move** corresponds to a transition with form $\delta(q, \epsilon, x)$ and a **$\epsilon$-stack move** corresponds to a transition with form $\delta(q, a, \epsilon)$.

A [[computability/index|language]] is called **deterministic context-free** if a deterministic pushdown automaton recognizes it. We note language $A$ is a DCFL if and only if $A{\dashv}$ is a DCFL.

## Context-Free Grammar

TODO

A **reduce step** is a reversed substitution, whereby the string of terminals and variables on the RHS of a rule is replaced by the variable on the corresponding LHS.

If $u$ and $v$ be strings of variables and terminals, write $u \rightarrowtail v$ to mean that $v$ can be obtained from $u$ by a reduce step. That is, $u \rightarrowtail v$ means the same as $v \Rightarrow u$. A **reduction from $u$ to $v$** is a sequence $$u = u_1 \rightarrowtail u_2 \rightarrowtail \cdots \rightarrowtail u_k = v$$

We say that **$u$ is reducible to $v$**, written $u \overset{*}\rightarrowtail v$, whenever $v \overset{*}\Rightarrow u$. The string being replaced is called the **reducing string**.
