## Overview

A (nondeterministic) **pushdown automaton** (PDA) is a $6$-tuple $\langle Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, F \rangle$, where $Q$, $\Sigma$, $\Gamma$, and $F$ are all finite sets, and

1. $Q$ is the set of states,
2. $\Sigma$ is the input alphabet,
3. $\Gamma$ is the stack alphabet,
4. $\delta \colon Q \times \Sigma_\epsilon \times \Gamma_\epsilon \rightarrow \mathscr{P}(Q \times \Gamma_\epsilon)$ is the transition function,
5. $q_0 \in Q$ is the start state, and
6. $F \subseteq Q$ is the set of accept states.

A [[computability/index|language]] is called **context-free** if a pushdown automaton recognizes it.

## Context-Free Grammar

A **context-free grammar** (CFG) is a $4$-tuple $\langle V, \Sigma, R, S \rangle$ where

1. $V$ is a finite set called the **variables** (or **nonterminals**).
2. $\Sigma$ is a finite set, disjoint from $V$, called the **terminals**.
3. $R$ is a finite set of **rules**, with each rule being a variable to a string of variables/terminals.
4. $S \in V$ is the **start variable**.

If $u$, $v$, and $w$ are strings of variables and terminals, and $A \rightarrow w$, we say that $uAv$ **yields** $uwv$ (denoted $uAv \Rightarrow uwv$). We say $u$ **derives** $v$ (denoted $u \overset{*}{\Rightarrow} v$), if $u = v$ or if a sequence $u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_k$ exists for $k \geq 0$ and $$u \Rightarrow u_1 \Rightarrow u_2 \Rightarrow \cdots \Rightarrow u_k \Rightarrow v.$$

A **derivation** of $w$ is a sequence of substitution steps, beginning with the start variable, that produces $w$. A derivation of a string $w$ in a grammar $G$ is a **leftmost derivation** if at every step the leftmost remaining variable is the one replaced.

### Ambiguity

A string $w$ is derived **ambiguously** in context-free grammar $G$ if it has two or more different leftmost derivations. Grammar $G$ is **ambiguous** if it generates some string ambiguously. A context-free language that can be generated only from an ambiguous grammar is called **inherently ambiguous**.

### Reductions

A **reduce step** is a reversed substitution, whereby the string of terminals and variables on the RHS of a rule is replaced by the variable on the corresponding LHS. If $u$ and $v$ be strings of variables and terminals, write $u \rightarrowtail v$ to mean that $v$ can be obtained from $u$ by a reduce step. A **reduction from $u$ to $v$** is a sequence $$u = u_1 \rightarrowtail u_2 \rightarrowtail \cdots \rightarrowtail u_k = v$$

We say that **$u$ is reducible to $v$**, written $u \overset{*}\rightarrowtail v$, whenever $v \overset{*}\Rightarrow u$. The string being replaced is called the **reducing string**.

A **reduction from $w$** is a reduction from $w$ to the start variable. A **leftmost reduction** is a reduction in which each reducing string is reduced only after all other reducing strings to its left.

Let $G$ be a CFG. A string that appears in a leftmost reduction of some string in $L(G)$ is called a **valid string**. Let $u_i$ be a valid string. In the reduce step $u_i \rightarrowtail u_{i+1}$, suppose rule $T \rightarrow h$ was applied in reverse. That is, $u_i = xhy$ and $u_{i+1} = xTy$ for some strings $x$ and $y$. Then $h$, along with reducing rule $T \rightarrow h$, is called a **handle** of $u_i$.

## Closure Operations

Let $A$ and $B$ be context free languages over alphabet $\Sigma$. Such languages are closed under the following:

* Union: $A \cup B = \{x \mid x \in A \lor x \in B \}$
* Reversal: $A^R = \{ x^R \mid x \in A \}$
* Concatenation: $A \circ B = \{ xy \mid x \in A \land y \in B \}$
* Kleene star: $A^* = \{ x_1x_2\cdots x_k \mid k \geq 0 \land x_i \in A \}$

## Chomsky Normal Form

A context-free grammar is in **Chomsky normal form** if every rule is of the form $$\begin{align*} S & \rightarrow \epsilon \\ A & \rightarrow BC \\ A & \rightarrow a \end{align*}$$

where $a$ is any terminal, and $A$, $B$, and $C$ are variables distinct from start variable $S$. This is typically done in stages:

1. Introduce a new start variable $S_0$ with rule $S_0 \rightarrow S$.
2. Eliminate all $\epsilon$-rules (except for the start variable).
	1. These are the rules that map a variable to $\epsilon$.
3. Eliminate all unit rules.
	1. These are the rules that map a variable to another variable.
4. Introduce new rules to match forms above.

What is the general strategy for proving e.g. $A = \{a^nb^nc^n \mid n \geq 0\}$ is not a context-free language?
Back: Assume $A$ is context-free. Use the pumping lemma to show a contradiction.

The pumping lemma for CFLs allows writing strings $s$ of length at least the pumping constant $p$ as $s = uvxyz$. What integral range does $\lvert vy \rvert$ fall in?
Back: $0 < \lvert vy \rvert$

The pumping lemma for CFLs allows writing strings $s$ of length at least the pumping constant $p$ as $s = uvxyz$. What integral range does $\lvert vxy \rvert$ fall in?
Back: $0 < \lvert vxy \rvert \leq p$
