## Overview

The **radix** is the number of unique digits used to represent numbers in a positional numeral system. Most commonly used systems tend to be binary ($2$-base), octal ($8$-base), decimal ($10$-base), and hexadecimal ($16$-base).

%%ANKI
Basic
What is the process of subtracting a larger digit from a smaller one in radix $r$?
Back: Decrement the next nonzero and add $r$ to the smaller digit in question.

## Scientific Notation

**Scientific notation** is a means of expressing non-zero values in base $b$ as $m \times b^n$. The number $m$ is called the **significand** (or **mantissa**). The number $n$ is called the **exponent**. Scientific notation is most commonly used in base $10$.

## Fixed-Point

**Fixed-point** refers to the representation of fractional numbers by storing a fixed number of digits of their fractional part. The most common variants of fixed-point arithmetic use base $10$ and base $2$.

In most cases, a fixed-point representation of a fractional number is as an integer to be implicitly multiplied by a fixed scaling factor. For example, number $1.23$ can be stored as integer $123$ with scaling factor $10^{-2}$.

## Floating-Point

**Floating-point** refers to the representation of fractional numbers by storing a **significand** (a signed sequence of a fixed number of digits in some base) multiplied by an integer power of that base. The most common variants of floating-point arithmetic use base $10$ and base $2$.

Floating-point can be seen as an example of [[#Scientific Notation|scientific notation]].
