## Overview

**Arithmetic** refers to the branch of mathematics dealing with the following mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and logarithms.

%%ANKI

What is arithmetic?
Back: A branch of mathematics dealing with, at its most basic level, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

%%ANKI

What are the four most basic operations employed in arithmetic?
Back: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

In a wider sense, arithmetic includes what other two operations beyond the basic four?

## Average Value

If $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ are $n$ real numbers, their **arithmetic mean** $\bar{a}$ is defined by the equation $$\bar{a} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n a_k.$$

If $w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n$ are nonnegative real numbers, not all zero, the **weighted arithmetic mean** $\bar{a}$ is defined by the formula $$\bar{a} = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^n w_ka_k}{\sum_{k=1}^n w_k}.$$

In this context, $w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n$ are called **weights**.
