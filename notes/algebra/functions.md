## Overview

A **function** $F$ is a single-valued [[relations|relation]]. We say $F$ **maps $A$ into $B$**, denoted $F \colon A \rightarrow B$, if and only if $F$ is a function, $\mathop{\text{dom}}F = A$, and $\mathop{\text{ran}}F \subseteq B$.

## Bijectivity

A function is **bijective** or a **one-to-one correspondence** if each element of the codomain is mapped to by exactly one element of the domain.

A function $f$ is **invertible** if and only if it is bijective. Such a function has an inverse, denoted $f^{-1}$ such that $f \circ f^{-1}$ and $f^{-1} \circ f$ is the identity function.

### Injectivity

A function is **injective** or **one-to-one** if each element of the codomain is mapped to by at most one element of the domain.

Assume that $F \colon A \rightarrow B$ is a function and $A \neq \varnothing$. Then there exists a function $G \colon B \rightarrow A$ (a **left inverse**) such that $G \circ F = I_A$ if and only if $F$ is one-to-one.

### Surjectivity

A function is **surjective** or **onto** if each element of the codomain is mapped to by at least one element of the domain. That is, **$F$ maps $A$ onto $B$** if and only if $F$ is a function, $\mathop{\text{dom}}A$, and $\mathop{\text{ran}}F = B$.

Assume that $F \colon A \rightarrow B$ is a function and $A \neq \varnothing$. Then there exists a function $G \colon B \rightarrow A$ (a right inverse) such that $F \circ G = I_B$ if and only if $F$ maps $A$ onto $B$.

## Monotonicity

A function $f$ is said to be **increasing** on a set $S$ if $f(x) \leq f(y)$ for every pair of points $x$ and $y$ in $S$ with $x < y$. If the strict inequality $f(x) < f(y)$ holds for all $x < y$ in $S$, the function is said to be **strictly increasing** on $S$.

Similarly, $f$ is called **decreasing** on $S$ if $f(x) \geq f(y)$ for all $x < y$ and **strictly decreasing** if $f(x) > f(y)$.

A function is **monotonic** on $S$ if it is increasing on $S$ or decreasing on $S$. It is **strictly monotonic** if it is either strictly increasing on $S$ or strictly decreasing on $S$.

### Top-down Approach

Let $f$ be a function from $B$ into $B$ and assume $A \subseteq B$. The top-down approach for constructing the closure $C$ of $A$ under $f$ defines $C^*= C$ to be the intersection of all closed supersets of $A$: $$C^* = \bigcap\, \{X \mid A \subseteq X \subseteq B \land f[\![X]\!] \subseteq X \}$$

### Bottom-Up Approach

Let $f$ be a function from $B$ into $B$ and assume $A \subseteq B$. The bottom-up approach for constructing the closure $C$ of $A$ under $f$ defines $C_* = C$ to be $$C_* = \bigcup_{i \in \omega} h(i)$$
where $h \colon \omega \rightarrow \mathscr{P}(B)$ is recursively defined as: $$\begin{align*} h(0) & = A, \\ h(n^+) &= h(n) \cup f[\![h(n)]\!]. \end{align*}$$

Note that the [[natural_numbers#Recursion Theorem|recursion theorem]] proves $h$ is indeed a function.

## Kernels

Let $F \colon A \rightarrow B$. Define [[relations#Equivalence Relations|equivalence relation]] $\sim$ as $$x \sim y \Leftrightarrow f(x) = f(y)$$
Relation $\sim$ is called the **(equivalence) kernel** of $f$. The [[relations#Partitions|partition]] induced by $\sim$ on $A$ is called the **coimage** of $f$ (denoted $\mathop{\text{coim}}f$). The **fiber** of an element $y$ under $F$ is $F^{-1}[\![\{y\}]\!]$, i.e. the preimage of singleton set $\{y\}$. Therefore the equivalence classes of $\sim$ are also known as the fibers of $f$.
