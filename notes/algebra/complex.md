## Overview

The set $\mathbb{C}$ of **complex numbers** is defined by $$\mathbb{C} = \{a + bi \mid a, b \in \mathbb{R}\},$$
where $i$ is the **imaginary number** defined as $i^2 = -1$.

## Operations

Addition and multiplication of complex numbers are done in the natural way. Given complex numbers $a + bi$ and $c + di$, we have that $$\begin{align*} (a + bi) + (c + di) & = (a + c) + (b + d)i \\ (a + bi) \cdot (c + di) & = (ac -bd) + (ad + bc)i \end{align*}$$

The **absolute value** of $a + bi$, denoted $\lvert a + bi \rvert$, is defined as $$\lvert a + bi \rvert = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}.$$
