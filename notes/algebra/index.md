## Overview

**Algebra** is the branch of mathematics that deals with abstract systems, i.e. algebraic structures, and the manipulation of expressions within those systems. It is a generalization of [[arithmetic/index|arithmetic]] that introduces variables and other algebraic operations.

## Equations

An **equation** is a relation between two expressions that may be true for some values of the variables. To **solve** an equation means to find all of the values for the variables that make the two expressions on either side of the equation equal to one another.

An **identity** is an equation that is true for all allowable values of the variables.

%%ANKI
Basic
In what way is it redundant to say "solve for an identity"?
Back: An identity already holds true for all allowable values of any variables.
