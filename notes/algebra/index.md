## Overview

An **equation** is a relation between two expressions that may be true for some values of the variables. To **solve** an equation means to find all of the values for the variables that make the two expressions on either side of the equation equal to one another.

An **identity** is an equation that is true for all allowable values of the variables.

In what way is it redundant to say "solve for an identity"?
Back: An identity already holds true for all allowable values of any variables.
