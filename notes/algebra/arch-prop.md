## Overview

If $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^+$, then there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $nx > y$. This fundamental property usually follows from the [[bounds#Completeness Axiom|completeness axiom]].

Given reals $x$ and $y$, what does the Archimedean property conclude?
Back: Indeterminate. We expect $x$ and $y$ to be positive reals.
