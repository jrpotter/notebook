## Overview

A **structure** is a pair $\langle A, R \rangle$ consisting of a set $A$ and a binary relation $R$ on $A$, i.e. $R \subseteq A \times A$.

What is a structure?
Back: A pair $\langle A, R \rangle$ consisting of a set $A$ and a binary relation $R$ on $A$.

%%ANKI
Basic
Let $\langle A, R \rangle$ be a structure. What kind of mathematical entity is $A$?
Back: A set.

A structure is a tuple of how many elements?
Back: Two.

%%ANKI
Basic
A poset is an example of what kind of abstract mathematical entity?
Back: A structure.

%%ANKI
Basic
What is a poset?
Back: A structure $\langle P, \leq \rangle$ such that $\leq$ is a partial order on set $P$.
Reference: Herbert B. Enderton, *Elements of Set Theory* (New York: Academic Press, 1977).
<!--ID: 1751416427787-->
END%%

%%ANKI
Basic
What distinguishes a poset from a partial order?
Back: The former is a structure. The latter is a relation.
