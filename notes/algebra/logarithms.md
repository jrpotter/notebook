## Overview

In the equation $b^y = x$, the exponent $y$ is known as the **logarithm** of the number $x$ using a **base** $b$, denoted $y = \log_b{x}$. The **characteristic** refers to the integer part of the logarithm whereas the **mantissa** refers to the fractional part. The mantissa is always a positive number between $0$ and $1$.
