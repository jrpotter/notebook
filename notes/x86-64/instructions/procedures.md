## Overview

The details of procedures are detailed in [[x86-64/procedures|procedures]]. This file touches on the most relevant instruction classes.

## CALL and RET

Like [[conditions#JMP|JMP]] instructions, `call` allows specifying a direct or indirect operand. `call` pushes the address of the instruction following it onto the stack and updates the PC to the operand. `ret` reverts these steps.

| Instruction | Operands    | Description      |
| ----------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| `call`      | Label       | Procedure call   |
| `call`      | \**Operand* | Procedure call   |
| `ret`       |             | Return from call |

Cloze
The {`call`} instruction is the counterpart to the {`ret`} instruction.

What two things does the `call` instruction do?
Back: It pushes the return address on the stack and updates the PC.

1: ...
2: callq .L1
3: ...
```
Back: `3`

## LEAVE

`leave` parallels the `ret` instruction. It is equivalent to the following two instructions:

```asm
movq %rbp, %rsp
popq %rbp
```

%%ANKI
Basic
What two things does the `leave` instruction do?
Back: Restores the stack pointer and pops off the caller-saved base pointer.
