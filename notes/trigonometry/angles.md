## Overview

An **angle** is formed by rotating a ray about its initial point. The ray in its initial position is called the **initial side** of the angle, and the position of the ray after it has been rotated is called the **terminal side** of the angle. The initial point of the ray is called the **vertex of the angle**.

When the vertex of an angle is at the origin in the Cartesian coordinate system, and the initial side lies along the positive $x$-axis, then the angle is in **standard position**.

An angle measuring less than $90\degree$ is called an **acute angle**. An angle measuring exactly $90\degree$ is called a **right angle**. An angle measure greater than $90\degree$ is called an **obtuse angle**.

## Subtended Angles

An angle **subtended by a line segment** at an arbitrary vertex is formed by the two rays between the vertex and each endpoint of the segment. An angle **subtended by an arc** of a curve is the angle subtended by the corresponding chord of the arc.

## Degrees and Radians

Angles are measures in **degrees** and **radians**.

An angle of $1\degree$ is the angle in standard position on the [[unit_circle|unit circle]] that is [[#Subtended Angles|subtended by]] an arc measuring $1/360$th of the circle's circumference.

An angle of $1$ radian is the angle in standard position on the unit circle that is subtended by an arc measuring the length of the circle's radius (in the positive direction).

On a circle of radius $r$, the arc length $s$ intercepted by a central angle with radian measure $\theta$ is $$s = r\theta.$$

Notice then that a radian measure is a ratio of two lengths (the quotient of the length of an arc by a radius of a circle), which makes radian measure a dimensionless quantity.
