## Overview

An **angle** is formed by rotating a ray about its initial point. The ray in its initial position is called the **initial side** of the angle, and the position of the ray after it has been rotated is called the **terminal side** of the angle. The initial point of the ray is called the **vertex of the angle**.

When the vertex of an angle is at the origin in the Cartesian coordinate system, and the initial side lies along the positive $x$-axis, then the angle is in **standard position**.
