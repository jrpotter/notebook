## Overview

**Geometry** is the branch of mathematics relating to the study of space and the relationships between points, lines, curves, and surfaces. It may be extended to the study of the higher dimensional analogs.

**Plane geometry** refers to the study of geometry limited to flat, two-dimensional [[similarity|shapes]] whereas **plane analytic geometry** refers to the study of plane geometry using algebraic methods.
