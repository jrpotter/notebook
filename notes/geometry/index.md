## Overview

Two sets are **congruent** if their points can be put in one-to-one correspondence in such a way that distances are preserved.

%%ANKI
Basic
Suppose sets $P$ and $Q$ are congruent. What does this imply the existence of?
Back: A bijection between $P$ and $Q$ that preserves distances between points.

%%ANKI
Basic
Suppose sets $P$ and $Q$ are congruent and $f$ is the corresponding bijection. What FOL proposition follows?
Back: $\forall p_1, p_2 \in P, \lvert p_1 - p_2 \rvert = \lvert f(p_1) - f(p_2) \rvert$
