## Overview

A **circle** is a shape consisting of all points in a plane at a given distance from a given point, i.e. the **center**. In this way, a circle is characterized by its center and **radius**, the distance from the center to any point of the circle.

The perimeter of a circle is known as its **circumference**. A circle with radius $r$ has circumference $2\pi r$ and [[area]] $\pi r^2$. A continuous segment along the circumference of a circle is called an **arc**.
