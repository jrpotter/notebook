## Overview

A **conic** is a curve obtained as the intersection of a plane (called the **cutting plane**) with the surface of a double cone (a cone with two **nappes**).

There are three types of conics: the ellipse, the parabola, and the hyperbola. The [[circle]] is a special kind of ellipse, though historically it was considered a fourth type.

Planes that pass through the vertex of the double cone will intersect the double cone in a point, a line, or a pair of intersecting lines. These are called **degenerate conics**.
