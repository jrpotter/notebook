## Overview

Let $f$ be a function of a single variable defined on interval $[a, b]$. We say $f$ is **convex** (or **convex downward** or **concave upward**) on $[a, b]$ if every chord joining two points on its graph lies above the graph. We say $f$ is **concave** (or **concave downward** or **convex upward**) on $[a, b]$ if instead every chord joining two points on its graph lies below the graph.
