## Overview

In [[geometry/index|plane analytic geometry]], the **Cartesian coordinate system** in a plane uniquely specifies a point by a pair of real numbers called its **coordinates**. These coordinates represent signed distances to the point from two fixed perpendicular oriented lines called the **axes**. The point where the axes meet is called the **origin** and have coordinates $\langle 0, 0 \rangle$.

Higher-dimensional analogs are formed in the natural way.

An equation that completely characterizes a figure within the Cartesian coordinate system is called a **Cartesian equation**.

## Transformations

There are two kinds of transformations that we can do to a graph: **shifting** and **scaling**. A **reflection** is a special case of scaling.

### Shifting

A **vertical shift** adds/subtracts a constant to every $y$-coordinate of a graph, leaving the $x$-coordinate unchanged. A **horizontal shift** adds/subtracts a constant to every $x$-coordinate of a graph, leaving the $y$-coordinate unchanged.

%%ANKI

### Scaling

A **vertical scaling** will multiply/divide every $y$-coordinate of a graph, leaving the $x$-coordinate unchanged. A **horizontal scaling** will multiply/divide every $x$-coordinate of a graph, leaving the $y$-coordinate unchanged.

Scaling is also known as **stretching** and **compressing**.

Back: A scaling changes the size and/or shape of the graph.
