## Overview

In plane analytic geometry, the **Cartesian coordinate system** uniquely specifies a point by a pair of real numbers called its **coordinates**. These coordinates represent signed distances to the point from two fixed perpendicular oriented lines called the **axes**. The point where the axes meet is called the **origin** and have coordinates $\langle 0, 0 \rangle$.

The "vertical line test" of a Cartesian coordinate system is used to determine what?
Back: Whether the tested graph depicts a function or not.

%%ANKI
Basic
In Cartesian coordinate systems, why does the vertical line test work?
Back: A function is single-valued. A vertical line that intersects a graph multiple times immediately contradicts this.
