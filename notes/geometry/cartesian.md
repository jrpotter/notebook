## Overview

In plane analytic geometry, the **Cartesian coordinate system** uniquely specifies a point by a pair of real numbers called its **coordinates**. These coordinates represent signed distances to the point from two fixed perpendicular oriented lines called the **axes**. The point where the axes meet is called the **origin** and have coordinates $\langle 0, 0 \rangle$.

The "vertical line test" of a Cartesian coordinate system is used to determine what?

In Cartesian coordinate systems, why does the vertical line test work?

## Translations

There are two kinds of translations that we can do to a graph: **shifting** and **scaling**. A **reflection** is a special case of scaling.

### Shifting

A **vertical shift** adds a constant to every $y$-coordinate of a graph, leaving the $x$-coordinate unchanged. A **horizontal shift** adds a constant to every $x$-coordinate of a graph, leaving the $y$-coordinate unchanged.

%%ANKI
Basic
What does it mean for a shift of a graph to be rigid?
Back: A shift does not change the size or shape of the graph.
