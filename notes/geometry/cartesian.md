## Overview

In plane analytic geometry, the **Cartesian coordinate system** uniquely specifies a point by a pair of real numbers called its **coordinates**. These coordinates represent signed distances to the point from two fixed perpendicular oriented lines called the **axes**. The point where the axes meet is called the **origin** and have coordinates $\langle 0, 0 \rangle$.

### Shifting

A **vertical shift** adds/subtracts a constant to every $y$-coordinate of a graph, leaving the $x$-coordinate unchanged. A **horizontal shift** adds/subtracts a constant to every $x$-coordinate of a graph, leaving the $y$-coordinate unchanged.

### Scaling

A **vertical scaling** will multiply/divide every $y$-coordinate of a graph, leaving the $x$-coordinate unchanged. A **horizontal scaling** will multiply/divide every $x$-coordinate of a graph, leaving the $y$-coordinate unchanged.

Scaling is also known as **stretching** and **compressing**.
