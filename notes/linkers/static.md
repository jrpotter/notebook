## Overview

To build an executable, a linker must perform two main tasks:

1. **Symbol resolution**. The linker must associate each symbol reference with exactly one symbol definition.
2. **Relocation**. The linker must relocate code and data sections by associating a memory location with each symbol definition, and then modifying all of the references to those symbols so that they point to this memory location.

The linker blindly performs relocations using detailed instructions generated by the assembler called **relocation entries**.

%%ANKI
Basic
What is the goal of relocation?
Back: To assign a memory location to each symbol and update references accordingly.

%%ANKI
Basic
*Why* must relocation happen after symbol resolution?
Back: We should not assign multiple addresses to the same symbol.

Basic
What does it mean for a linker to relocate a code and/or data section?
Back: It associates a memory location with each symbol definition and updates references accordingly.
