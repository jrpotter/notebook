## Overview

To build an executable, a linker must perform two main tasks:

1. **Symbol resolution**. The linker must associate each symbol reference with exactly one symbol definition.
2. **Relocation**. The linker must relocate code and data sections by associating a memory location with each symbol definition, and then modifying all of the references to those symbols so that they point to this memory location.

The linker blindly performs relocations using detailed instructions generated by the assembler called **relocation entries**.

According to Bryant et al., a static linker must perform what two tasks?
Back: Symbol resolution and relocation.

%%ANKI
Basic
What is the goal of relocation?
Back: To assign a memory location to each symbol and update references accordingly.

%%ANKI
Basic
*Why* must relocation happen after symbol resolution?
Back: We should not assign multiple addresses to the same symbol.

%%ANKI
Basic
What does it mean for a linker to relocate a code and/or data section?
Back: It associates a memory location with each symbol definition and updates references accordingly.

## Object Files

Object files come in three forms:

1. [[relocatable|Relocatable object files]]. Contains binary code and data in a form that can be combined with other relocatable object files at compile time.
2. **Executable object files**. Contains binary code and data in a form that can be copied directly into memory and executed.
3. **Shared object files**. A special type of relocatable object file that can be loaded into memory and linked dynamically, at either load time or run time.

An **object module** is a sequence of bytes whereas an **object file** is an object module stored on disk.
