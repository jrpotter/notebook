## Overview

A **formal system** is an abstract structure and formalization of an axiomatic system used for inferring theorems from axioms by a set of inference rules. It consists of two components: a **formal language** and a **deductive system**.

A formal language comprises of an **alphabet** and a **formal grammar**. The grammer has associated rules describing how symbols of the alphabet are manipulated to create **well-formed formulas** (WFFs). The **syntax** of a language describes the set of possible expressions that are valid utterances. The **semantics** of a language describe what these valid utterances actually mean.

A deductive system can be further subcategorized as either a [[formal_system/proof_system/index|proof system]] or a [[formal_system/logical_system/index|logical system]]. In both cases, the general principle is to define a (possibly empty) set of **axioms** alongside a set of **inference rules** that together can be used to infer **theorems**.
