## Overview

A **cache** is a storage device that acts as a staging area for data objects stored in a larger, slower device. The process of using a cache is known as **caching**.

%%ANKI
Basic

%%ANKI
Basic
With respect to caching, how do block sizes tend to change as we move further down the memory hierarchy?
Back: Block sizes tend to get larger.

%%ANKI
Basic
With respect to caching, *why* do block sizes tend to increase as we move further down the memory hierarchy?
Back: To amortize against the longer access times.
