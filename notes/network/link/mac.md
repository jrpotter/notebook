## Overview

Medium access control (MAC) refers to a link layer subprotocol.

A MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to an [[infrastructure#NICs|NIC]] for use as a network address. Such addresses are typically assigned by the hardware manufacturer. They are represented as six groups of 2 [[radices|hexadecimal]] digits, possibly separated by some delimiter (e.g. colons, hyphens, etc.).
