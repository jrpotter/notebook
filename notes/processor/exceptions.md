## Overview

An **exception** is an abrupt change in the control flow in response to some change in the processor's state. The change in state is known as an **event**.

When an event occurs, the processor makes an indirect procedure call (the exception), though a jump table (the **exception table**), to an operating system subroutine (the **exception hander**) specifically designed to process this kind of event.

Afterward, one of the following occurs:

1. The handler returns control to the current instruction.
2. The handler returns control to the instruction that would have executed had the exception not occurred.
3. The handler aborts the interrupted program.

## Exception Table

Every exception is given a unique nonnegative integer called its **exception number**. This is used as an index into the exception table in which entry $k$ contains the address of the handler for exception $k$.

The starting address of the exception table is contained in a special CPU register called the **exception table base register** (ETBR).

There exist four classes of exceptions with the following characteristics:

Name | Cause | Async/Sync | Return Behavior
---- | ---- | ---- | ----
