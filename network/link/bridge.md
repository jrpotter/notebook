## Overview

A **bridge** is a networking device that creates a single, aggregate network from multiple different networks or network segments.

## Switches

A **switch** is a networking device that connects multiple devices together. Multiple data cables are plugged into a switch to enable communication between different networked devices.

A switch is more intelligent than an Ethernet **hub**, which retransmits packets out of every hub except the port on which the packet was received.

What is the purpose of a switch?
Back: To enable communication between multiple connected devices.

What distinguishes a switch from an Ethernet hub?
Back: The former can relay packets to a specific device. The latter retransmits to all connected devices.
