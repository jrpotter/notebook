## Overview

The L2 layer in the [[osi|OSI]] model refers to the link layer. PDUs at this layer are typically called **frames**. These are usually variable-sized; the upper bound on how large a frame can be is called the **maximum transmission unit** (MTU).

The IEEE 802 set of standards defines operations related to local area networks (LANs) and metropolitan area networks (MANs).
