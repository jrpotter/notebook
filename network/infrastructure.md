## Firewalls

A **firewall** is a network security system that controls incoming and outgoing traffic based on configurable security rules. These rules are collectively known as **firewall rules**.

**Network-based** firewalls are positioned between two or more networks. **Host-based** firewalls are deployed directly on a host.

## Gateways

A **gateway** is a networking device that communicates using more than one protocol to connect two discrete networks. The term is overloaded though. Other common use cases include:

* With respect to HTTP, a gateway refers to a [[#Proxies|reverse proxy]].
* With respect to traditional home networks, a **(residential) gateway** refers to a device that combines [[#Routers|router]] and [[#Modems|modem]] functionality.

## Modems

A **modem** (modulator-demodulator) is a device that converts data from a digital format into a format suitable for analog transmission. It transmits data by modulating one or more carrier wave signals to encode digital information, while the receiver demodulates the signal to recreate the original digital information.

## Proxies

A **proxy server** describes a server application that acts as an intermediary between a client requesting a resource and a server providing that resource.

![[proxies.png]]

A **forward proxy** is a server that routes traffic between clients and another system, usually external to the clients' network. A **reverse proxy** is a server that accepts requests from clients, forwarding them to one of many other servers.

The former typically protects clients whereas the latter typically protects servers.
