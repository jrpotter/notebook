## Overview

A **gateway** is a networking device that communicates using more than one protocol to connect two discrete networks. The term is overloaded though. Other common use cases include:

* With respect to HTTP, a gateway refers to a [[#Proxies|reverse proxy]].
* With respect to traditional home networks, a **(residential) gateway** refers to a device that combines [[#Routers|router]] and [[#Modems|modem]] functionality.
