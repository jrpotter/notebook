## Overview

In the equation $b^y = x$, the exponent $y$ is known as the **logarithm** of the number $x$ using a **base** $b$, denoted $y = \log_b{x}$. The **characteristic** refers to the integer part of the logarithm whereas the **mantissa** refers to the fractional part. The mantissa is always a positive number between $0$ and $1$.

In real analysis, base $b$ is restricted to a positive value $\neq 1$. That is, $0 < b < 1$ or $b > 1$.

## Common Bases

A few notational conveniences are introduced for common bases.

### Natural

The **natural logarithm**, denoted $\ln{x}$, assumes a base $e$.

Oftentimes the logarithm is defined before [[exponentials]]. If $x$ is a positive real number, the natural logarithm is defined as the following [[riemann|Riemann integral]]: $$\ln{x} = \int_1^x \frac{1}{t} \,dt.$$
