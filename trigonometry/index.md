## Overview

Trigonometry was originally derived from a Greek word meaning "triangle measuring". It has since been generalized to refer to the study of periodicity.

## Angles

An **angle** is formed by rotating a ray about its initial point. The ray in its initial position is called the **initial side** of the angle, and the position of the ray after it has been rotated is called the **terminal side** of the angle. The initial point of the ray is called the **vertex of the angle**.

When the vertex of an angle is at the origin in the [[cartesian|Cartesian coordinate system]], and the initial side lies along the positive $x$-axis, then the angle is in **standard position**.

### Subtended Angles

An angle **subtended by a line segment** at an arbitrary vertex is formed by the two rays between the vertex and each endpoint of the segment. An angle **subtended by an arc** of a curve is the angle subtended by the corresponding chord of the arc.

### Measurements

Angles are measures in **degrees** and **radians**.

An angle of $1\degree$ is the angle in standard position on the [[unit_circle|unit circle]] that is [[#Subtended Angles|subtended by]] an arc measuring $1/360$th of the circle's circumference. An angle of $1$ radian is the angle in standard position on the unit circle that is subtended by an arc measuring the length of the circle's radius (in the positive direction).

On a circle of radius $r$, the arc length $s$ intercepted by a central angle with radian measure $\theta$ is $$s = r\theta.$$

Notice then that a radian measure is a ratio of two lengths (the quotient of the length of an arc by a radius of a circle), which makes radian measure a dimensionless quantity.

## Sinusoidal Functions

Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be constants with $B \neq 0$. A **sinusoidal function** is one of form $$A\sin{(B[t - C])} + D.$$

The graph of a sinusoidal function is called a **sinusoidal wave** (or **sinusoid**). Both $y = \sin{(t)}$ and $y = \cos{(t)}$ are sinusoidal waves. 

The **amplitude** of a sinusoid is one-half the distance between the minimum and maximum functional values. That is, $$\text{Amplitude} = \frac{1}{2} \lvert (\text{max } y\text{-coordinate}) - (\text{min } y\text{-coordinate}) \rvert$$

A horizontal shift of a sinusoid is called a **phase shift**.
