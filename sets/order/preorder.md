## Overview

A binary relation $R$ on set $A$ is a **non-strict preorder on $A$** iff it is reflexive on $A$ and transitive. If $R$ is instead irreflexive on $A$, it is a **strict preorder**.

%%ANKI
Basic
A binary relation on $A$ is a preorder on $A$ if it satisfies what two properties?
Back: Reflexivity on $A$ and transitivity.

## Boundedness

Let $P$ be a preordered set with order relation $\leq$.

Given some subset $S$ of $P$, an **upper bound** of $S$ is some $U \in P$ such that $U$ is greater than or equal to every element of $S$. We say $S$ is **bounded above** by $U$. A **lower bound** of $S$ is some $L \in P$ such that $L$ is less than or equal to every element of $S$. We say $S$ is **bounded below** by $L$.

A preordered set with no upper bound is said to be **unbounded above**. A preordered set with no lower bound is said to be **unbounded below**.

### Extremums

A real-valued function $f$ is said to have an **absolute maximum** on a set $S$ if there is at least one point $c \in S$ such that $f(x) \leq f(x)$ for all $x \in S$. $f$ is said to have an **absolute minimum** on $S$ if there is at least one point $d \in S$ such that $f(d) \leq f(x)$ for all $x \in S$.

$f$ is said to have a **relative maximum** at a point $c \in S$ if there is an open interval $I$ containing $c$ such that $f(x) \leq f(c)$ for all $x \in I \cap S$. Likewise, $f$ is said to have a **relative minimum** at a point $d \in S$ if there is an open interval $I$ containing $c$ such that $f(d) \leq f(x)$ for all $x \in I \cap S$.

An **extremum** (or **extreme value**) of $f$ is either a relative maximum or a relative minimum of $f$.

### Supremums and Infimums

Let $P$ be a preordered set with order relation $\leq$.

Given some subset $S$ of $P$, a member $M \in P$ is a **supremum** (or **least upper bound**) of $S$ if $M$ is an upper bound for $S$ and no member less than $M$ is an upper bound for $S$. This is denoted as $M = \mathop{\text{lub}} S$ or $M = \mathop{\text{sup}} S$.

A member $m \in P$ is an **infimum** (or **greatest lower bound**) of $S$ if $m$ is a lower bound for $S$ and no member greater than $m$ is a lower bound for $S$. This is denoted as $m = \mathop{\text{glb}} S$ or $m = \mathop{\text{inf}} S$.
