## D20 Tests

A **D20 Test** is a d20 roll used to determine success or failure. The test follows these steps:

1. Roll 1d20.
2. Add Modifiers. These include the relevant [[abilities|ability modifier]], proficiency bonus, and circumstantial bonuses/penalties.
3. Compare the total to a target number.

if a creature has **Advantage**, they instead roll 2d20 and choose the higher number. If a creature has **Disadvantage**, they instead roll 2d20 and choose the lower number. If a creature is in a situation that imposes both Advantage and Disadvantage, they only roll 1d20.

### Proficiency

All creatures have a **Proficiency Bonus** reflecting the impact that training has on a creature's capabilities. A character's Proficiency Bonus increases as they gain levels whereas a monster's Proficiency Bonus depends on their Challenge Rating.

Such a bonus is applied to a D20 Test when the creature has proficiency in a [[abilities#Skills|skill]], in a [[abilities#Saving Throws|saving throw]], or with an item. It is also used for spell attacks and for calculating the DC of saving throws for spells.

| Level or CR | Bonus |
| ----------- | ----- |
| Up to 4     | +2    |
| 5-8         | +3    |
| 9-12        | +4    |
| 13-16       | +5    |
| 17-20       | +6    |
| 21-24       | +7    |
| 25-28       | +8    |
| 29-30       | +9    |
