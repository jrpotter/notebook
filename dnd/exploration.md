## Vision

An area is said to be **Lightly Obscured** if vision is slightly obstructed. For example, in areas with patchy fog or moderate foliage. Wisdom (Perception) checks relying on sight are rolled with [[dnd/index#D20 Tests|Disadvantage]].

An area is said to be **Heavily Obscured** if vision is completely obscured. For example, in areas with heavy fog or dense foliage. Unless otherwise stated, creatures in Heavily Obscured areas are afflicted with the Blinded condition.

The presence or absence of light determines the category of illumination in an area. An area of **Bright Light** lets most creatures see normally. **Dim Light** creates a Lightly Obscured area. **Darkness** creates a Heavily Obscured area.
