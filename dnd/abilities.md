## Overview

All creatures have six abilities that measure physical and mental characteristics. They are:

* **Strength**: Physical might.
* **Dexterity**: Agility, reflexes, and balance.
* **Constitution**: Health and stamina.
* **Intelligence**: Reasoning and memory.
* **Wisdom**: Perceptiveness and mental fortitude.
* **Charisma**: Confidence, poise, and charm.

Each ability has a score from 1 to 20, although some monsters have a score as high as 30. The score represents the magnitude of an ability.

| Score | Meaning                                                                                                           |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | This is the lowest a score can normally go. If an effect reduces a score to 0, that effect explains what happens. |
| 2-9   | This represents a weak capability.                                                                                |
| 10-11 | This represents the human average.                                                                                |
| 12-19 | This represents a strong capability.                                                                              |
| 20    | This is the highest an adventurer's score can go unless a feature says otherwise.                                 |
| 21-29 | This represents an extraordinary capability.                                                                      |
| 30    | This is the highest a score can go.                                                                               |

Each ability has a modifier that is applied whenever making a [[dnd/index#D20 Tests|D20 Test]] with that ability. Derive the modifer by subtracting 10 from the ability score, and then dividing by 2, rounding down.
