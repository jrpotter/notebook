## Initiative

The order of turns is determined at the beginning of combat when everyone rolls **Initiative**. This is a [[abilities#Ability Check|Dexterity check]] that determines a creature's turn in the Initiative order. Groups of identical creatures usually share Initiative.

If a combatant is **surprised** by combat starting, that combatant has Disadvantage on their Initiative roll.

If there is a tie in the Initiative checks:

* The DM decides the order among tied monsters.
* The DM decides the order among tied monsters and players.
* The players decide the order among tied players.

## Armor Class

A creature's **Armor Class** (AC) represents how well the creature avoids being wounded in combat. All creatures start with the same **base AC** calculation of 10 plus the creature's Dexterity modifier. The creature's AC can be further modified by armor, magic items, spells, etc.

### Cover

There are three degrees of **Cover** providing benefits from attacks or other effects originating on the opposite side of the cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies.

## Attack Rolls

Attack rolls are [[dnd/index#D20 Tests|D20 Tests]] that determine whether an attack hits a target. An attack roll hits if the roll equals or exceeds the target's Armor Class. An ability modifier is added to the result of the attack roll depending on the type of attack:

* The Strength modifier is added if performing a melee attack with a weapon.
* The Strength modifier is added if performing an Unarmed Strike.
* The Dexterity modifier is added if performing a ranged attack with a weapon.
* The Spellcasting modifier is used for a spell attack.

### Melee Attacks

A **melee attack** refers to an attack that happens within reach. Unless otherwise noted, creatures have a 5-foot reach. A melee attack typically uses a hand-held weapon or an **Unarmed Strike**.

The latter refers to a melee attack using one's body to damage, grapple, or shove a target. A creature making an Unarmed Strike can choose one of the following three effects to take place:

* **Damage**. An attack roll is made against the target. The bonus equals the Strength modifier plus the [[dnd/index#Proficiency|Proficiency Bonus]].
	* On a hit, the target takes Bludgeoning damage equal to 1 plus the Strength modifier.
* **Grapple**. The target must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (it chooses which). Otherwise it is [[creatures#Conditions|Grappled]].
	* The DC for the saving throw and any escape attempts equals 8 plus the Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus.
	* This option is available only if the target is no more than one size larger than the attacker and the attack has a hand free.
* **Shove**. The target must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (it chooses which). Otherwise it is pushed 5 feet away or has the [[creatures#Conditions|Prone]] condition.
	1. The DC for the saving throw equals 8 plus the Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus.
	2. This option is available only if the target is no more than one size larger than the attacker.

### Ranged Attacks

A **ranged attack** refers to an attack that happens over a distance. A ranged weapon or spell can specify one or two ranges.

* Normal Range. If a single range is specified, the attacker cannot target something beyond this range.
* Long range. If two ranges are specified, attacks against targets further than the smaller range is made with Disadvantage. The attack cannot target something beyond the larger range.

A ranged attack is rolled with Disadvantage if made against a creature that can see the attacker, is within 5 feet of the attacker, and is not [[creatures#Conditions|Incapacitated]].
