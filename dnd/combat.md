## Initiative

The order of turns is determined at the beginning of combat when everyone rolls **Initiative**. This is a [[abilities#Ability Check|Dexterity check]] that determines a creature's turn in the Initiative order. Groups of identical creatures usually share Initiative.

If a combatant is **surprised** by combat starting, that combatant has Disadvantage on their Initiative roll.

If there is a tie in the Initiative checks:

* The DM decides the order among tied monsters.
* The DM decides the order among tied monsters and players.
* The players decide the order among tied players.

## Attack Rolls

Attack rolls are [[dnd/index#D20 Tests|D20 Tests]] that determine whether an attack hits a target. An attack roll hits if the roll equals or exceeds the target's Armor Class. An ability modifier is added to the result of the attack roll depending on the type of attack:

* The Strength modifier is added if performing a melee attack with a weapon.
* The Strength modifier is added if performing an Unarmed Strike.
* The Dexterity modifier is added if performing a ranged attack with a weapon.
* The Spellcasting modifier is used for a spell attack.
