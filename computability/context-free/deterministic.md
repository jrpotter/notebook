## Overview

A **deterministic pushdown automaton** (DPDA) is a $6$-tuple $\langle Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, F \rangle$, where $Q$, $\Sigma$, $\Gamma$, and $F$ are all finite sets, and

1. $Q$ is the set of states,
2. $\Sigma$ is the input alphabet,
3. $\Gamma$ is the stack alphabet,
4. $\delta \colon Q \times \Sigma_\epsilon \times \Gamma_\epsilon \rightarrow (Q \times \Gamma_\epsilon) \cup \{ \varnothing \}$ is the transition function,
5. $q_0 \in Q$ is the start state, and
6. $F \subseteq Q$ is the set of accept states.

For every $q \in Q$, $a \in \Sigma$, and $x \in \Gamma$, exactly one of the values is not $\varnothing$:

* $\delta(q, a, x)$;
* $\delta(q, a, \epsilon)$, an **$\epsilon$-stack move**;
* $\delta(q, \epsilon, x)$, an **$\epsilon$-input move**;
* $\delta(q, \epsilon, \epsilon)$, an $\epsilon$-stack and $\epsilon$-input move.

A [[computability/index|language]] is called **deterministic context-free** if a DPDA recognizes it.

## Closure Operations

Let $A$ and $B$ be deterministic context free languages over alphabet $\Sigma$. Such languages are closed under the following:

* Complementation: $\overline{A} = \{ w \in \Sigma^* \mid w \not\in A \}$
* Endmark: $A{\dashv} = \{ w{\dashv} \mid w \in A \}$
	* In fact, $A$ is a DCFL if and only if $A{\dashv}$ is a DCFL.

Furthermore, the intersection of a DCFL with a [[regular|regular language]] is deterministic context-free.

How do we show DCFLs are closed under concatenation (using say DCFGs $A$ and $B$)?
Back: N/A. DCFLs are not generally closed under concatenation.

Let $C$ be a DCFL and $R$ be a regular language. What can be said about $C \cap R$?
Back: It must be deterministic context-free.

Let $D$ be a DCFL and $R$ be a regular language. What strategy is used to show $D \cap R$ is a DCFL?
Back: Use the product construction to form a DPDA that recognizes $D \cap R$.

Let $D$ be a DCFL, $R$ be a regular language, and $P$ be the DPDA recognizing $D \cap R$. What are $P$'s states?
Back: $Q \times Q'$, where $Q$ is the states of $D$'s DPDA and $Q'$ is the states of $R$'s DFA.
